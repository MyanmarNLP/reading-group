# Schedule

This is a reading group for [Stanford NLP's CS224N](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html#schedule). We will mainly follow the official CS224N schedule, with slight modification.
Before each class, please read the respective lecture notes and watch the videos for that week. Lecture notes and videos can be found on CS224N website.

This is a community-led class. We will require one or two volunteer presenters each week who will present the topic and lead the discussion. 

Main textbooks and resources:
